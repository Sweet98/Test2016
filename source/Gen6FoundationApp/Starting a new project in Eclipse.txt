Starting a new project in Eclipse

1. Make a new project sandbox.
2. To open a project you need to do the following:
	* Open Eclipse
	* Open a Workspace pointing to your sandbox folder. (the contents of this folder contain the folders 		“Gen6FoundationApp” and “.metadata”
	* Open a new Project
		o From File menu
		o New
		o Project
	* Select a General Project, click next
	* Name the project “Gen6FoundationApp”
	* Click Finish.

Building a project:
   You should see a list of all the files in the project located on the left menu.
   You can build the project using a make file by:
	* Right click the top project folder, (Gen6FoundationApp).
	* Select “Build Make Target”
	* Select the target you would like to build
	* Click OK

When you open a new workspace, eclipse will try to do a “build all” which is unsupported by our make file.  You can change the “build automatically” setting by:
	* Open the window menu
	* Select “preferences”
	* Expand the general list located on the left of the dialog box
	* Select the “workspace” function
	* Under workspace you can uncheck the build “build automatically” box.

Under the preferences menu you can also change “Save automatically before build” and show line numbers.  You will need to change these settings every time you open a new workspace.
