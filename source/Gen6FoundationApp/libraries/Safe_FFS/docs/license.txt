CMX Systems, Inc., Software License

The enclosed software and documentation are the exclusive property of CMX Systems, Inc. (CMX) and CMX Company, a division of CMX Systems, Inc., protected under the copyrights laws of the United States of America and under international treaty provisions. LICENSOR is an authorized licensor of CMX software products (herein referred to as the "SOFTWARE"). LICENSOR agrees to grant LICENSEE a license to use the SOFTWARE and LICENSEE agrees to pay for this license in accordance to the terms specified. By using the SOFTWARE, the LICENSEE has agreed to the terms set forth in this Agreement whether or not this Agreement is read.

This License (including the Exhibits hereto) shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this License, and shall not be altered, varied, revised or amended except in writing signed by both parties.  The provisions of this License supersede all prior oral or written quotations, communications, agreements and understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this License.  Neither this License nor any Exhibit may be modified or amended except by the mutual written agreement of authorized representatives of each party.  Any purchase order issued shall be for its administrative purposes only and none of its terms and conditions shall be of any force or effect.

GRANT OF LICENSE: LICENSOR grants to licensee a nontransferable license to use the SOFTWARE. LICENSEE acknowledges that by virtue of this Agreement, LICENSEE acquires only the right to use the SOFTWARE and does not acquire any right of ownership in the SOFTWARE.  LICENSOR authorizes the purchaser to make backup copies of the SOFTWARE for archival purposes only. The respective license is effective until terminated. You may terminate it by destroying the SOFTWARE and documentation and all copies thereof. The license will also terminate if you fail to comply with any terms or condition of this agreement. You agree upon such termination to destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and documentation. LICENSOR offers a PER USER license, a PER PRODUCT license, a PER PRODUCT LINE license and a PER CPU TYPE license based upon the SOFTWARE purchase terms and as defined below:

PER USER LICENSE: CMX authorizes the purchaser to have only a single user use the SOFTWARE as a "single seat license" on a royalty free basis. For each "single seat license", only one (1) person may use this software at a specified site and CMX will only support that single person. The SOFTWARE or its accompanying documentation must not be copied or distributed to others in any way. This License allows you to embed  (e.g. Hex format) CMX product software into any number of End-Products using a single, specific, processor type and its derivatives (e.g. 68HC12, 80x86, ARM, ColdFire, PowerPC, etc.). You can manufacture an unlimited number of units of each of those products, for the life of the end-products that use the specified Processor Type. Examples of End-Products can be a combination of all of the following; so long as they ALL use the Processor Type and the derivatives are: HDTV's, VCRs, DVD Players, MP3 Players, etc.

PER PRODUCT LICENSE: CMX authorizes the purchaser to have as many users at a single facility use this software, but only one user may be the point of contact for technical support and CMX will only support that single person. If additional technical support is required by more than one person, then the LICENSEE may purchase SUPPORT licenses for those additional people. The SOFTWARE or its accompanying documentation may be copied and distributed to others only within the same facility. This license allows you to embed (e.g. Hex format) CMX product software into one end-product which can be manufactured in any quantity, for the life of the end-product. In other words, this is a royalty free license but a different license is required for each different end product (i.e. model) that embeds the CMX Software even if the end product is in the same family as a previously licensed end product by a different model number or processor type. For changes such as using a different language or color, etc. we will consider it the same product. This license is specific to the Processor Type used AND the specific name and model of the end product. Examples of a Single Product include any single model of a TV, Cell Phone, VCR, DVD Player, Dishwasher, etc.
 
PER PRODUCT LINE LICENSE: CMX authorizes the purchaser to have as many users at a single facility use this software, but only two users may be the point of contact for technical support and CMX will only support the two people. If additional technical support is required for additional people, then the LICENSEE may purchase SUPPORT licenses for those additional people. The SOFTWARE or its accompanying documentation may be copied and distributed to others only within the same facility. This license allows you to embed  (e.g. Hex format) CMX product software into any number of End-Products within a 'Product Family' using a specific Processor Type (e.g. 68HC12, 80x86, ARM, ColdFire, PowerPC, etc.). You can manufacture an unlimited number of units of each of those products, for the life of the end-products within the product family. In other words, this is a royalty free license but applicable to all end-products that do similar functions within the same Product Family and Processor Type (and its derivatives) used. Examples of End-Product lines (using same Processor Type and the derivatives) are: TV's, Cell Phones, VCRs, DVD Players, Dishwashers, etc.

PER CPU TYPE LICENSE: CMX authorizes the purchaser to have as many users at a single facility use this software, but only three users may be the point of contact for technical support and CMX will only support the three people. If additional technical support is required for additional people, then the LICENSEE may purchase SUPPORT licenses for those additional people. The SOFTWARE or its accompanying documentation may be copied and distributed to others only within the same facility. This license allows you to embed  (e.g. Hex format) CMX product software into any number of End-Products using a specific Processor Type (e.g. 68HC12, 80x86, ARM, ColdFire, PowerPC, etc.). You can manufacture an unlimited number of units of each of those products, for the life of the end-products that use of the specified Processor Type. Examples of Per-CPU Type End-Products can be a combination of all of the following; so long as they ALL use the Processor Type and the derivatives are: HDTV's, VCRs, DVD Players, MP3 Players, etc.

TERMS OF SOFTWARE: LICENSEE agrees not to distribute the SOFTWARE source code to any third party in any manner. LICENSEE'S use of the SOFTWARE shall be limited to integrating the SOFTWARE as an integral component within the LICENSEE'S own product (PER PRODUCT PER SITE) or products (PER USER PER SITE), depending upon the type of license acquired from LICENSOR. LICENSEE shall have the right to distribute the SOFTWARE as an integral component of the LICENSEE'S own products as long as the SOFTWARE is in absolute machine readable format (e.g., HEX file). The LICENSEE can NOT sell a product that allows the user(s) of the licensee product(s) to be able to indirectly call the CMX functions (e.g., The licensee product contains an API [Application Program Interface] that allows the user(s) to indirectly call and use the CMX functions), without the user(s) of the licensee's product(s) also purchasing a license to use the SOFTWARE.

LIMITATION OF LICENSOR'S LIABILITY: LICENSOR shall not be liable for any damages, including but not limited to, interruption of business, loss of profit, incidental, consequential or any other claims either by LICENSEE or any other party. LICENSOR shall not be liable for any damages incurred by LICENSEE or any other person as a result of LICENSEE'S use or misuse of the SOFTWARE, even if LICENSOR had been advised of the possibility of such damage.

SEVERABILITY: If any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal, unenforceable or in conflict with any law governing this Agreement, the validity of remaining portions shall not be effected thereby.

NON-WAIVER: Failure of LICENSOR at any time to require performance of this Agreement shall not limit LICENSOR'S right to enforce the provision, nor shall any waiver by LICENSOR of any breach of provision constitute a waiver of or prejudice LICENSOR'S right otherwise to demand strict performance or the provision or any other provision.

U.S. GOVERMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS: This SOFTWARE and documentation are restricted computer software and are provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Use, duplication, or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions of the sort set forth in subparagraph (c) (1) (ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software Clause at DFARS 252.227-7013.

LIFE SUPPORT APPLICATIONS: CMX SOFTWARE is not designed for use in life support appliances, devices or systems where malfunction of the SOFTWARE can reasonably be expected to result in a personal injury. CMX customers using or selling CMX SOFTWARE for use in such applications do so at their own risk and agree to fully indemnify CMX for any damages resulting from such improper use or sale.

WARRANTIES: LICENSOR represents and warrants the following: That LICENSOR has the right to grant LICENSEE a license to use the SOFTWARE and to enter into this Agreement. That the physical media, on which the SOFTWARE is shipped, is free from defects and that if a defect is found, a replacement copy will be provided. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others which vary from state to state.

LICENSEE EXPRESSLY AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AN IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

GOVERNING LAW: This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Florida.

Some states do not allow limitations on the duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitations may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from state to state. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you.
